# PatchGen

> Generate Pd patches using natural language prompts.

## What is PatchGen

This project focuses on training and fine-tuning a language model to generate Pd patches based on natural language descriptions. Purr Data (Pd) is a visual programming language commonly used for creating interactive computer music and multimedia. Training an LLM to generate Pd patches poses a unique challenge, as the model must learn to understand, interpret and produce patches from textual input.

See the [Quick start](quickstart.md) guide for more details.
