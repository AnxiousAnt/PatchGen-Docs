### How to Prompt the Model

To get the best results from the model, it's advisable to provide clear, simple prompts that resemble the instructions seen during training. Below are some examples that were used in the instruction fine-tuning phase:

- **`Create a Pure Data patch that calculates the absolute value of a given negative number.`**
- **`Create a Pure Data patch that renders a 3D teapot with adjustable size and detail level.`**
- **`Create a Pure Data patch that renders a square with adjustable size and color, responding to create, destroy, and draw messages.`**
- **`Create a Pure Data patch that takes a floating-point number as input, calculates its absolute value modulo 7, and displays the result.`**
- **`Create a Pure Data patch that adds 10 and 20 when a bang is triggered and prints the result.`**
- **`Create a Pure Data patch that takes a floating-point input and outputs the arc sine of that value, with a button to trigger the calculation.`**
- **`Create a Pure Data patch that takes two input numbers, squares the first number and adds the square root of the second number, then outputs the result.`**
- **`Create a Pure Data patch that generates white noise, applies a high-pass filter with an adjustable frequency threshold, and allows for volume adjustment before outputting the audio signal.`**
- **`Create a Pure Data patch that performs a bitwise AND operation on two input values and prints the result.`**
- **`Create a Pure Data patch that generates a random melody automatically, with a toggle to start and stop the melody, and a volume control.`**
- **`Create a Pure Data patch that generates pseudo-random numbers using a sine wave function.`**
- **`Create a Pure Data patch that takes an input value, pipes it through a 500ms delay, and outputs the delayed value.`**
- **`Create a Pure Data patch that generates pink noise and allows for volume control before sending the audio signal to the digital-to-analog converter.`**
- **`Create a Pure Data patch that scales the size of particles by a specified factor every frame.`**
- **`Create a Pure Data patch that generates a band-pass filtered noise signal with adjustable center frequency, Q, and volume.`**

Using prompts in this format will guide the model toward generating more accurate and functional patches.
